# ðŸ“˜ System Design Mastery (LLD + HLD)

Welcome to the **System Design Mastery Course**!  
This repository is designed to prepare you for **senior software engineering roles**, with a focus on **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **High-Level Design (HLD)**.

By the end, you will be able to:  
âœ… Write clean, extensible, and scalable **object-oriented designs** (LLD)  
âœ… Architect large-scale systems like **Netflix, Uber, and Twitter** (HLD)  
âœ… Crack **System Design interviews** with confidence  
âœ… Apply principles in **real-world projects**

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **LLD/** â†’ Learn OOP, design principles, patterns, and case studies
- **HLD/** â†’ Dive into distributed systems, databases, caching, queues, and large-scale architectures
- **Advanced/** â†’ Explore event-driven design, consensus, observability, and APIs
- **Interview_Preparation/** â†’ Frameworks, trade-offs, mock problems, and pitfalls
- **Projects/** â†’ Hands-on capstone projects like social media, chat apps, video streaming, etc.

- Security (OAuth, JWT, HTTPS)
- Case Studies: URL Shortener, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, E-commerce

### **4. Advanced Topics**
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Distributed Consensus (Paxos, Raft)
- Database Internals (Indexes, Isolation)
- Monitoring & Observability
- API Design Best Practices (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)

### **5. Interview Preparation**
- Framework for solving system design problems
- Trade-offs discussion (latency vs throughput, consistency vs availability)
- Mock problems & pitfalls

### **6. Capstone Projects**
